# CarrierWave Backgrounder [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lardawge/carrierwave_backgrounder.png)](http://travis-ci.org/lardawge/carrierwave_backgrounder)

I like CarrierWave. That being said, I don't like tying up app instances waiting for images to process.

This gem addresses that issue by disabling processing until a background process initiates it.
It supports Delayed Job, Resque and Girl Friday.

## Background options

There are currently two offerings for backgrounding upload tasks which are as follows;

```ruby
Backgrounder::ORM::Base::process_in_background
```

This method stores the original file and does no processing or versioning. Optionally you can add a column to the database which will be set to nil when the background processing is complete.

```ruby
Backgrounder::ORM::Base::store_in_background
```

This method does nothing to the file after it is cached which makes it super fast. It requires a column in the database which stores the cache location set by carrierwave. The drawback to using this method is the need for a central location to store the cached files. This leave heroku out. Heroku may deploy workers on separate servers from where your dyno cached the files. That being said, I only recommend using this method if you have full control over your temp storage directory.

## Installation

These instructions assume you have previously set up [CarrierWave](https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave) and [DelayedJob](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) or Resque

In Rails, add the following your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'carrierwave_backgrounder'
```

## Getting Started

In an initializer:

```ruby
CarrierWave::Backgrounder.configure do |c|
  # :delayed_job, :girl_friday, :sidekiq, :qu, :resque, or :qc
  c.backend :delayed_job 
end
```

If you would like to use a custom queue name for Delayed Job, Resque, Girl Friday, Sidekiq and Qu pass in the following option.
The queue name will default to carrierwave.

```ruby
CarrierWave::Backgrounder.configure do |c|
  c.backend :delayed_job, queue: :awesome_queue 
end
```

You can also pass additional configuration options to girl_friday

```ruby
CarrierWave::Backgrounder.configure do |c|
  c.backend :girl_friday, queue: :awesome_queue, size: 3, store: GirlFriday::Store::Redis
end
```

In your CarrierWave uploader file:

```ruby
class AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  include ::CarrierWave::Backgrounder::Delay

  #etc...
end
```

### To use process_in_background

In your model:

```ruby
mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
process_in_background :avatar
```

Optionally you can add a column to the database which will be set to nil when the background processing is complete.

```ruby
add_column :users, :avatar_processing, :boolean
```

### To use store_in_background

In your model:

```ruby
mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
store_in_background :avatar
```

Add a column to the model you want to background which will store the temp file location:

```ruby
add_column :users, :avatar_tmp, :string
```

## Usage Tips

### Bypass backgrounding
If you need to process/store the upload immediately:

```ruby
@user.process_<column>_upload = true
```

### Override worker
To overide the worker in cases where additional methods need to be called or you have app specific requirements, pass the worker class as the
second argument:

```ruby
process_in_background :avatar, MyAppsAwesomeProcessingWorker
```
### Testing with Rspec
We use the after_commit hook when using active_record. This creates a problem when testing with Rspec because after_commit never gets fired
if you're using trasactional fixtures. One solution to the problem is to use the [TestAfterCommit gem](https://github.com/grosser/test_after_commit).
There are various other solutions in which case google is your friend.

## ORM

Currently ActiveRecord is the default orm and I have not tested this with others but it should work by adding the following to your carrierwave initializer:

```ruby
DataMapper::Model.send(:include, ::CarrierWave::Backgrounder::ORM::Base)
# or
Mongoid::Document::ClassMethods.send(:include, ::CarrierWave::Backgrounder::ORM::Base)
# or
Sequel::Model.send(:extend, ::CarrierWave::Backgrounder::ORM::Base)
```

Contributions are gladly accepted from those who use these orms.
