# CarrierWave Backgrounder

I like CarrierWave. That being said, I don't like tying up app instances waiting for images to process. This gem addresses that issue.

## Background options
  
There are currently two offerings for backgrounding upload tasks which are as follows;

```ruby
Backgrounder::ORM::Base::process_in_background
```

This method stores the original file and does no processing or versioning. Optionally you can add a column to the database which will be set to nil when the background processing is complete.

```ruby
Backgrounder::ORM::Base::store_in_background
```

This method does nothing to the file after it is cached which makes it super fast. It requires a column in the database which stores the cache location set by carrierwave. The drawback to using this method is the need for a central location to store the cached files. This leave heroku out. Heroku may deploy workers on separate servers from where your dyno cached the files. That being said, I only recommend using this method if you have full control over your temp storage directory.

## Installation

These instructions assume you have previously set up [CarrierWave](https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave) and [DelayedJob](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job)

In Rails, add the following your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'carrierwave_backgrounder'
```

## Getting Started

### To use process_in_background
    
In your model:
    
```ruby
mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
process_in_background :avatar
```

### To use store_in_background
    
In your model:

```ruby
mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
store_in_background :avatar
```

Add a column to the model you want to background which will store the temp file location:

```ruby
add_column :users, :avatar_tmp, :string
```

In your CarrierWave uploader file:

```ruby
class AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  include ::CarrierWave::Backgrounder::DelayStorage

  #ect...
end
```

## Usage Tips

If you need to process/store the upload immediately:

```ruby
@user.process_<column>_upload = true 
```

## ORM

Currently ActiveRecord is the default orm and I have not tested this with others but it should work by adding the following to your carrierwave initializer:

```ruby
DataMapper::Model.send(:include, ::CarrierWave::Backgrounder::ORM::Base)
# or
Mongoid::Document::ClassMethods.send(:include, ::CarrierWave::Backgrounder::ORM::Base)
# or
Sequel::Model.send(:extend, ::CarrierWave::Backgrounder::ORM::Base)
```

Contributions are gladly accepted from those who use these orms.
