---
NOTICE: Version 1.1.0 contains a change in behavior from previous version. When a record is deleted before the job is picked up, it will no longer raise an error. Prior to this change, when using `process_in_background`, if a record was missing, an error was raised. Some users might have relied on that. By default, this will no longer happen. If you want to maintain that behavior, you must set the `suppress_record_not_found_errors` configuration to `false`. This will raise a RecordNotFound error.

I am a fan of CarrierWave. That being said, I don't like tying up requests waiting for images to process.

This gem addresses that by offloading processing or storaging/processing to a background task.
We currently support ActiveJob and Sidekiq.

## Background options

There are currently two offerings for backgrounding upload tasks which are as follows;

```ruby
# This stores the original file with no processing/versioning.
# It will upload the original file to s3.
# This was developed to use in cases where you do not have access to the cached location such as Heroku.

Backgrounder::ORM::Base::process_in_background
```

```ruby
# This does nothing to the file after it is cached which makes it fast.
# It requires a column in the database which stores the cache location set by carrierwave so the background job can access it.
# The drawback to using this method is the need for a central location to store the cached files.
#
# IMPORTANT: Only use this method if you have full control over your tmp storage directory and can mount it on every deployed server.

Backgrounder::ORM::Base::store_in_background
```

## Installation and Usage

These instructions assume you have previously set up [CarrierWave](https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave) and your queuing lib of choice.

Take a look at the [Rails app](spec/support/dummy_app) to see examples of setup.

In Rails, add the following your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'carrierwave_backgrounder'
```

Run the generator which will create an initializer in config/initializers.
```bash
rails g carrierwave_backgrounder:install
```

You can pass additional configuration options to Sidekiq:

```ruby
CarrierWave::Backgrounder.configure do |c|
  c.backend :sidekiq, queue: :awesome_queue, size: 3
end
```

**IMPORTANT FOR SIDEKIQ BACKEND** - carrierwave (default queue name) should be added to your queue list or it will not run:

```yml
:queues:
  - [carrierwave, 1]
  - default
```

In your CarrierWave uploader file you will need to add a cache directory as well as change cache_storage to File:

```ruby
class AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  include ::CarrierWave::Backgrounder::Delay

  # This is required if you are using S3 or any other remote storage.
  # CarrierWave's default is to store the cached file remotely which is slow and uses bandwidth.
  # By setting this to File, it will only store on saving of the record.
  cache_storage CarrierWave::Storage::File

  # It is recommended to set this to a persisted location if you are using `::store_in_background`.
  def cache_dir
    "path/that/persists"
  end

  #etc...
end
```

### To use process_in_background

In your model:

```ruby
mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
process_in_background :avatar
```

Optionally you can add a column to the database which will be set to `true` when
the background processing has started and to `false` when the background processing is complete.

This is set to true in the after_commit hook when the job is created. It is very useful if you are waiting to notify the user of completion.

```ruby
add_column :users, :avatar_processing, :boolean, null: false, default: false
```

### To use store_in_background

In your model:

```ruby
mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
store_in_background :avatar
```

Add a column to the model which will store the temp file location:

```ruby
add_column :users, :avatar_tmp, :string
```

## Usage Tips

### Bypass backgrounding
If you need to process/store the upload immediately:

```ruby
@user.process_<column>_upload = true
```

This must be set before you assign an upload:

```ruby
@user = User.new
@user.process_avatar_upload = true
@user.attributes = params[:user]
```

### Override worker
To override the worker in cases where additional methods need to be called or you have app specific requirements, pass the worker class as the second argument:

```ruby
process_in_background :avatar, MyParanoidWorker
```

Then create a worker that subclasses carrierwave_backgrounder's worker.
Each method, #store_in_background and #process_in_background has there own worker.

#### For Sidekiq
`process_in_background` subclass `::CarrierWave::Workers::ProcessAsset`
`store_in_background` subclass `::CarrierWave::Workers::StoreAsset`

#### For ActiveJob
`process_in_background` subclass `::CarrierWave::Workers::ActiveJob::ProcessAsset`
`store_in_background` subclass `::CarrierWave::Workers::ActiveJob::StoreAsset`

```ruby
# Sidekiq Example

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
  process_in_background :avatar, MyParanoidWorker
end

class MyParanoidWorker < ::CarrierWave::Workers::ProcessAsset
  # ...or subclass CarrierWave::Workers::StoreAsset if you're using store_in_background

  def error(job, exception)
    report_job_failure  # or whatever
  end

  # other hooks you might care about
end
```

```ruby
# ActiveJob Example

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
  process_in_background :avatar, MyActiveJobWorker
end

class MyActiveJobWorker < ::CarrierWave::Workers::ActiveJob::StoreAsset
  after_perform do
    # your code here
  end
end
```
